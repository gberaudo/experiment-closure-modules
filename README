Howto split code with closure and load lazily at runtime

Principle
Cesium code is in cesium.js (foreign dependency)
Cesium extern is in CesiumExterns.js (externs)
ol3-cesium depends on Cesium (we skipped irrelevent dependency on OL3)
app is the application code optionally depending on app3d
app3d depends on ol3cesium and instanciate objects from olcs, contain 3D controls...


Testing
npm install
./compile.sh
Open test.html in a browser
